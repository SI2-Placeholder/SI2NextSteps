What is the next step for NSF SI2 PIs?

The 2016 NSF SI2 PI meeting was held on February 16 and 17 in Arlington Virginia. 
In the "next step" discussion, there were many ideas. This serves as a forum for
further discussion and, more important, to develop actionable items.

Please share your opinions about these topics:

1. What are the essential skills for a new member joining a project that has heavey software development?

2. What are the skills for your specific domains?
